The stadium features multiple tiers of seating arranged in a concentric pattern around the field, indicating a design intended to accommodate a significant number of spectators. The field itself is rectangular and appears to be well-maintained, with distinct markings typical of a sports pitch. Surrounding the stadium are various structures, including what seems to be parking areas and possibly administrative buildings. The stadium is situated near a road network, with visible roads leading to and from the site. To the north, there is an adjacent green area, possibly a park or recreational space, while to the east, residential or commercial buildings are present. The overall layout suggests a well-planned urban setting designed to support large-scale events."
